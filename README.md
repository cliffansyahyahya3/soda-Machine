Vending Machine Simulation (C++)

This project is a console-based vending machine simulation written in C++. It was created to practice object-oriented programming by using classes to model how a real vending machine works.

FEATURES
  - View available drinks and price
  - User input money and purchase
  - automatically sum and give change using constructors
  - Destructor for clearing data
  - Display information of drinks remainder and $ earned

Class
  - Public functions: Allow interaction with the machine (displayChoices, buyDrink).
  - Private functions: Handle internal processing (inputMoney, dailyReport).
  - reference: drinkInformation& drinkInfo (drinkTypes) - manage drink types and inventory

Concepts Demonstrated
  - Classes and objects
  - Constructors and destructors
  - Encapsulation (public vs private members)
  - References
  - Input validation
  - Basic inventory and money management

Example Program Flow
  - Display available drinks
  - User selects a drink
  - User inserts money
  - Program checks price and calculates change
  - Inventory and earnings are updated
  - Daily report is displayed
